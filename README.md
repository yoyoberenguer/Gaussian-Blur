# Gaussian-Blur

Python implementation of 2D Gaussian blur filter methods using multiprocessing

**WIKIPEDIA**

In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also known as Gaussian smoothing) is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function (named after mathematician and scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss). It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scalesâ€”see scale space representation and scale space implementation.
Mathematically, applying a Gaussian blur to an image is the same as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. This is also known as a two-dimensional Weierstrass transform. By contrast, convolving by a circle (i.e., a circular box blur) would more accurately reproduce the bokeh effect. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, applying a Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter.

A box blur (also known as a box linear filter) is a spatial domain linear filter in which each pixel in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of its neighboring pixels in the input image. It is a form of low-pass ("blurring") filter. A 3 by 3 box blur can be written as 1/9 * determinant matrix:

I developped two types of 5x5 blur techniques (using multiprocessing and cython performances) 

The first technique is using a C-buffer type data as input image.
Methods below are repectively used for 24 and 32 bit image format.
Both methods returns a pygame.Surface (blurred image)
```python
# bloom.pyx line 174 : 
cpdef blur5x5_buffer24(rgb_buffer, width, height, depth, mask=None):
    return blur5x5_buffer24_c(rgb_buffer, width, height, depth, mask=None)
    
# bloom.pyx line 177 :
cpdef blur5x5_buffer32(rgba_buffer, width, height, depth, mask=None):
    return blur5x5_buffer32_c(rgba_buffer, width, height, depth, mask=None)
```

Second method takes a numpy 3d array as input image and return a pygame Surface 

```python
bloon.pyx line 180 :
cpdef blur5x5_array24(rgb_array_, mask=None):
    return blur5x5_array24_c(rgb_array_, mask=None)

bloom.pyx line 183 :
cpdef blur5x5_array32(rgb_array_, mask=None):
    return blur5x5_array32_c(rgb_array_, mask=None)
```
    
e.g : blur5x5_array24_c

```python 
@cython.boundscheck(False)
@cython.wraparound(False)
@cython.nonecheck(False)
@cython.cdivision(True)
cdef unsigned char [:, :, ::1] blur5x5_array24_c(unsigned char [:, :, :] rgb_array_, mask=None):
